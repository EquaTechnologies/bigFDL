![bigFDL Gambling Bot Image](https://equabg.neocities.org/bigfdl.png)

# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ULTRA IMPORTANT!!! ⚠️⚠️⚠️
THIS BOT HAS ;eval ENABLED FOR **EVERYONE**. It just has a simple filter to prevent (let's hope all) dangerous commands. BUT **DO NOT RELY ON IT!!!**
If you plan on making your own bot with this code, I suggest you to make this eval function only for the bot owner to use.

# Bot Description
Wanna gamble? But not with real money?
24/7?  Saves progress across servers?
Minimal permissions? Patches for bugs?
Look no further than, bigFDL!

Use ;help for all the commands.

# Links

# Setup

The setup process is **EXTREMELY** easy.
1. Download the Python file in the repository. It should be only one.
2. Go to the Discord Developer Portal and make a Discord bot. Copy the token. **(DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN TO ANYONE AND IF YOU DO RESET IT IN THE DEVELOPER PORTAL!!!)**
3. Open the file and modify the code however you want. Go to the end of the code and you should see a place to put your token there.
4. Create an Oauth2 link for the bot

And yet again, it is reccomended to remove or make it owner-only the *;eval* command.
